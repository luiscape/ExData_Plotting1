Programming Assignment 1
========================

In this assignment are required to plot a dataset from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) using R base graphics. The dataset we are using can be downloaded [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) (it's about electric power consumption).

Code
----

Using R's base graphics, the code to reproduce the plots -- under the `Reference` label below --is available in R scripts respectively labelled with the plot name (e.g. `plot1.R`). The script `run.R` can run all the plotting scripts above. And the script `load_data.R` loads the UC Irvine data (the data must be in a folder called `/data` placed in the working directory with the original dataset, in TXT form, inside).


Resulting Plots
---------------

The resulting plots can be seen in the [graphics](XXX) folder in this repository.


Reference
---------

The assignemnt requires us to reproduce the following graphics:

### Plot 1
